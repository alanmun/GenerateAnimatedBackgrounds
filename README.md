# GenerateAnimatedBackgrounds
Quickly create animated backgrounds for anything from videos

## About

I made this to quickly grab cool looking animated backgrounds for animated tracks off of [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rentoNxY6RA)

But since this project uses yt-dlp to grab videos, you could use this tool to make animated backgrounds off of videos you found from any of these sources and more:
- YouTube
- Vimeo
- Facebook
- Instagram
- Twitter
- TikTok
- Dailymotion
- Twitch
- Bilibili
- SoundCloud
- Youku
- Niconico
- Odysee
- Rumble
- Pornhub, Xvideos, Redtube (they're supported by yt-dlp...)
- Newgrounds
- PeerTube
- LiveLeak (okay you nasty ðŸ˜­)
- Bandcamp
- Tumblr
- BBC iPlayer
- NBC
- CBC
- ABC
- ARTE TV
- FranceTV
- Mediaset
- Canal+
- MTV
- Crunchyroll
- Discovery
- TLC
- HGTV
- Food Network

And because this solution uses ffmpeg and Python, it is cross-platform and should work on Windows, Linux, and MacOS. Sorry FreeBSD users I don't know if you have ffmpeg or not


## Dependencies (Required installs before you can use)

You must have:
- ffmpeg installed (tested with ffmpeg version 7.1 on Win11. Other versions likely work too. The main thing is that you have access to the `libwebp_anim` module in ffmpeg, as its needed to convert to `.webp`
- yt-dlp installed (tested with version `2025.02.19`)
- Python (tested with 3.11.2, but as old as 3.8.x should work)

## Setup/Install

Assuming you have the aforementioned dependencies, you can

`git clone
